# Lab Report 1 - Remote Access and FileSystem
---
## Example 1:
```
#code block
[user@sahara ~]$ cd
[user@sahara ~]$ 
```
The working directory when the program was run was "/home". "cd" is the command that is supposed to take you into a directory.
Having no other arguments means that you are trying to go into no directory, which means that the output, which shows that you're
at the same working path, makes sense.
I don't think the output (or the execution of the command) was an error because the cd command is intended to be used to move into
a directory in the working path. I think it makes sense that the working path doesn't change when no additional arguments are given
because the user doesn't specify which directory they want to go into.
