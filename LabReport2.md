I think I learned a lot in Week 2 of CSE 15L, when we began the handling of servers and URIs. I've previously only been familiar with the part 
of computer science and software development that involved algorithms and basic full-stack development. I really appreciate gaining knowledge
about things like starting a server and running code on remote environment with commands like ssh, scp, and more that depict a different perspective
of CS. I really like how there's a lot of things that make our lives a bit easier when coding, like using "~" when you don't know a specific path to
a directory or file, and even things like the "man" command that show us how to use and learn about more commands.
